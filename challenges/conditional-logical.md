## OR LOGICAL Challenge

Challenge:
Write a JavaScript code that takes in a string and checks if the string contains either the word "apple" or the word "banana". If it does, log `true`; otherwise, log `false`.

Starter Code:

```javascript
let text = "I love bananas!";
```

In this code challenge, we directly assign a value to the `text` variable. We then use the logical OR (`||`) operator to check if either of the two conditions is true:

## AND LOGICAL Challenge

Challenge:
Write a JavaScript code that takes in a number and determines if the number is both even and positive. If it is, log `true`; otherwise, log `false`.

Starter Code:

```javascript
let num = 4;
```

In this version, we directly assign a value to the `number` variable. We then use the logical AND (`&&`) operator to check if two conditions are true simultaneously:
