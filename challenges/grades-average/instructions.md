# Grade Average

Create a program that uses a single prompt that is inside of a loop that runs a total of 3 times. At the end of the last entry the computer will output the average grade and assign it a grade letter.

A: 90-100
B: 80-89
C: 70-79
D: 60-69
F: 0-59

- You will need to keep track of the running total. Then find the average of the 3.

Example Output:

If the user enters scores of 85, 92, and 78: "Your average score is 85. Your grade is B."
If the user enters scores of 70, 65, and 72: "Your average score is 69. Your grade is D."

## Extra Bonus:

Keep the program running until someone types the word `quit`.
HINT: You may need a while loop for this one and have an internal counter to keep track of how many times you have entered a grade.
